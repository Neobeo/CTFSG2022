# CTFSG2022

I thoroughly enjoyed the competition this year, not least because my team (Social Engineering Experts 2) won it. Special thanks to all the organisers.

Here are the challenges I intend to write up on:
- [SHA CBC](SHA-CBC.ipynb) (Crypto / 1 solve)
- [Textbook RSA](TextbookRSA.ipynb) (Crypto / 2 solves)
- [ThreePass](ThreePass.ipynb) (Misc / 3 solves)
- [WhichLee V2](WhichLeeV2.ipynb) (Misc / 1 solve)

Other ones I don't intend to write up on, but could be persuaded to:
- Roll Your Own AE (Crypto / 2 solves)
- TOTOTT2 (Crypto / 3 solves)
- White Cage (Reverse Engineering / 2 solves)
