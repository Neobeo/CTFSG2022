    "In this challenge, we are given three 8-digit integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, and have to compute `q(x,y,z)` (as given in the token):\n",
    "```\n",
    "def q(x,y,z):return sum([q(~-x,y,z-f)for f in range(-~y)])%0x39bfef87 if x else z==0\n",
    "print(q(*map(int,input().split())))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The catch is it has to run within three seconds, and the function above will almost definitely not complete within that time. Through some investigation, it should become apparent that $q(x,y,z)$ counts the number of ways to place $z$ identical balls into $x$ distinguishable boxes, such that no box contains more than $y$ balls. Equivalently, we can denote this in terms of generating functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ q(x,y,z) = \\left[t^z\\right]\\left(\\frac{1-t^{y+1}}{1-t}\\right)^x, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the notation $\\left[t^z\\right]$ denotes the coefficient of $t^z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an easy check that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left(1-t^{y+1}\\right)^x = \\sum_{i=0}^x \\binom{x}{i} (-t)^{i(y+1)} \\,\\text{ and }\\, (1-t)^{-x}=\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty\\binom{x-1+i}{x-1}t^i.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, we can combine these two to get a simple enough form for our desired function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ q(x,y,z) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\left\\lfloor z/(y+1)\\right\\rfloor} (-1)^i \\binom{x}{i} \\binom{x-1+z-i(y+1)}{x-1}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the values we get from the challenge, we have never seen a value of $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{z}{y+1}\\right\\rfloor$ that exceeds 5, so it is a very practical sum to evaluate for the purpose of this challenge. We use `gmpy2.bincoef` to calculate the binomial coefficient."

    "How often do we get a 0? Let's find out, using observed bounds for x,y,z. Roughly speaking though, $\\binom{n}{k}$ is roughly 50% likely to be a multiple of $p$ if $n$ and $k$ are both larger than $p$, and that probability increases as $n$ and $k$ become much larger than $p$. However, we are adding a few of these binomial coefficients, so we'd need all of them to be zero to get a final response value of 0, which brings the probability down overall to around 11.8% (by Monte Carlo)."
