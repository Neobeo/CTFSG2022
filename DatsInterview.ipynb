    "Unfortunately, I did not solve this live during the CTF.SG competition. There were unintended solutions that involve the server not checking for negative values, but since we don't have the server code I did not explore these, and assumed that the specifications given on the PDF were golden.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code that is used to solve the Stone Statues problem looks simple enough, and I think I managed to convince myself that it is logically sound and does not produce incorrect answers. In that case, the vulnerability must be in the 10-second limit, but I wasn't entirely sure how to make it slow enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intended solution path mentioned after the hunt ended was about the dictionary hash, and in hindsight this is actually kind of obvious, so this write-up is an attempt to solve it as such. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that it takes linear time to add `n` elements into a dictionary, but only if we expect the hashes to be well-behaved. In the worst case where every element turns out to have the same hash, then we'd need quadratic time, since each insertion would first need to check that none of the previous elements (that have the same hash) are in fact the same element.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy python dictionaries use to resolve hash collisions is called [Open addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing), and in particular here's a great explanation of [how python dictionaries work](https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-10-how-python-dictionaries-work/), or better yet [an explorable explanation](https://just-taking-a-ride.com/inside_python_dict/chapter4.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "So first things first, can we actually have 100000 elements resolving to the same hash? It turns out that hashing an integer is just taking it mod $2^{61}-1$, so because of the `long long` limit we can only have 8-9 elements for any given hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know to due the 2/3-load factor that a dictionary with 100000 elements must have a table size of $2^{18}=262144$, so that any two integers differing by a multiple of 262144 must end up in the same initial bucket. However, because their hash is not identical, these upper bits of the hash are use to make them probe into different trajectories. What we want to do is force these different hashes to eventually resolve to the same trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately we can have 8 copies of each hash, so that for each hash we have 8 \"attempts\" to get it into a trajectory of interest. For example, consider the starting value 47933, which will have the following trajectory:\n",
    "![47933](dats47933.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The red arrows here means that it's perturbed, and subsequently after the first three reds the hash will hash shifted enough to reach no perturbation, so that it ends up in the same trajectory as zero. The important point here, is that in this example you need at least four copies of the hash for it to do something substantial here: the first three are simply dummies. In general, since we can make 8 copies of each hash, we can allow for seven perturbations. All-in-all, this means that we have a runtime of $O\\left(\\left(\\frac{n}{8}\\right)^2\\right)$, which is quadratic.\n",
    "\n",
    "All that remains is to find 12500 such hashes that enter the zero trajectory within 7 steps. We will just brute force over a big enough range and collect all such candidates. We use `numba.jit` to speed things up."
